🧩 Custom Hooks Implementation – React Lab


Module 10 lab $ 

    Creating custom React hooks, specifically usePagination and UseDebounce.

** Lessons Learned**

I get why we're not using Typescript.  I described it in my mock interview as pushing a button on a car to start it.  It gives me zero insight into how the car runs, but somehow allows me to say I know 'everything' about cars.  So I get it, and I get why it is used in industry, but it is not valuable for my learning, honestly.
